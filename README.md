cabrillo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/thxo/cabrillo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/thxo/cabrillo)
---------------------
A Python library to parse Cabrillo-format amateur radio contest logs, with no external dependencies.

# Fork Status
I'm not actively working on this project right now (Sept 2023) as I'm not doing much Python or ham radio stuff at the moment. 
I may pick it up again later, but for now this repo is in maintenance mode. PRs and contributions are still welcome.

The differences between this fork and the upstream repo are:
- Switch to the Poetry build system ([PR #3](https://github.com/ranguli/cabrillo/pull/3))
- Add ADIF to Cabrillo conversion ([PR #3](https://github.com/ranguli/cabrillo/pull/3))
- Add missing fields/values from the Cabrillo spec ([PR #1](https://github.com/ranguli/cabrillo/pull/1), contributed back upstream)

# Getting Started

## Basic Parsing

```python
>>> from cabrillo.parser import parse_log_file
>>> cab = parse_log_file('tests/CQWPX.log')
>>> cab.callsign
'AA1ZZZ'
>>> cab.qso
[<cabrillo.qso.QSO object at 0x10cb09f28>, <cabrillo.qso.QSO object at 0x10cbc8860>]
>>> cab.text()
'START-OF-LOG: 3.0\nCREATED-BY: WriteLog V10.72C\nCALLSIGN: AA1ZZZ\n[...snip...]END-OF-LOG:\n'
```

You can also write to a file:

```python
with open('out.cbr', 'w') as o:
    cab.write(o)
```

The same works for text-file-like objects.

Finally, if you desire to parse Cabrillo data already present as a Python string,
you can do so with, e.g.,

```python
from cabrillo.parser import parse_log_text

cabrillo_text = """START-OF-LOG: 3.0
END-OF-LOG:
"""

cab = parse_log_text(cabrillo_text)
```

## Ignoring malorder

Cabrillo logs must be time-sorted. If you want to read files that are
not so sorted, but other than that are Cabrillo files, you can do so by
adding a keyword argument `ignore_order=False` to either `parse_log_file`
or `parse_log_text`. If you do that, the resulting Cabrillo object
will refuse to generate (potentially non-)Cabrillo output.

## Matching Two QSOs in Contest Scoring

```python
>>> # We start off with a pair with complementary data.
>>> from cabrillo import QSO
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> qso1 = QSO('14313', 'PH', datetime.strptime('May 30 2018 10:15PM', '%b %d %Y %I:%M%p'), 'KX0XXX', 'KX9XXX', de_exch=['59', '10', 'CO'], dx_exch=['44', '20', 'IN'], t=None)
>>> qso2 = QSO('14313', 'PH', datetime.strptime('May 30 2018 10:10PM', '%b %d %Y %I:%M%p'), 'KX9XXX', 'KX0XXX', de_exch=['44', '20', 'IN'], dx_exch=['59', '10', 'CO'], t=None)
>>> qso1.match_against(qso2)
True
>>> qso1.freq = '14000'  # Same band, still will match.
>>> qso1.match_against(qso2)
True
>>> qso1.match_against(qso2, max_time_delta=1)  # Make time checking less lenient.
False
>>> # All flags.
>>> qso1.match_against(qso2, max_time_delta=30, check_exch=True, check_band=True)
```

## Contributors

Pull requests are appreciated!

The following instructions show how to obtain the sourcecode and execute the tests.
They assume Python 3.3 or later: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thxo/cabrillo.git
cd cabrillo
python3 -m venv python-venv
source python-venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
python -m pytest --cov-report term-missing --cov cabrillo -v
```

On a Windows machine, using `cmd.exe`, substitute
`python-venv/Scripts/activate` for
`source python-venv/bin/activate`.
